    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Tetris is a video game created by a Russian software engineer that became popular worldwide. In the game, there is a grid-environment where differently shaped blocks “fall” from the top of the grid to the bottom. It is the user’s job to arrange the blocks (by moving them left and right and/or rotating them) so that they can survive as long as possible without any of the blocks accumulating all the way to the top of the grid. Rows can be dissolved (therefore giving the user more space) if every single grid in a row is filled by any part of a block (a ‘tetris’ is a quadruple of rows filled and cleared at the same time) [<sup>[1]</sup>](#historyoftetrisnote). Strategy for the game involves trying to maximize the number of cleared rows and tetrises, especially when the goal is to receive as many points as possible. In the situation where the goal is to “stay alive” as long as possible, the main goal is to keep the highest block as low as possible, often by virtue of row-clearings and/or tetrises.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 2013 paper introduced the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) [<sup>[2]</sup>](#alenote) that we plan to utilize in this project. ALE’s goal is to provide an interface to hundreds of Atari game environments, as well as methods to evaluate and compare approaches used to train agents in these games. There are different methods for feature construction and three simple baseline agents: Random, which picks a random action every frame, Const, which picks a single action throughout an episode, and Perturb, which selects a fixed action with a 95% probability and is uniformly random otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "It has been proven that even in an offline version of Tetris, it is NP-complete to “maximize the number of cleared rows, maximize the number of tetrises, minimize the maximum height of an occupied square, or maximize the number of pieces played before the game ends” [<sup>[3]</sup>](#nphardnote). These results held when players were restricted to only 2 rotation/translation moves before each piece drops in height, restricted piece sets, and with an infinitely tall gameboard. This is why we are interested in testing the performance of different models and hyperparameters as we train an agent to play the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even before the 2013 ALE was released, there were several attempts at training an agent to play Tetris. In 1996, Tsitsiklis & Van Roy used feature-based dynamic programming (number of holes and height of the highest column) to achieve a score of around 30 cleared lines on a 16x10 grid [<sup>[4]</sup>](#dpnote). In the same year, Bertsekas & Tsitsiklis added the height of each column and the difference in height between adjacent columns as features. They achieved a higher score of 2800 lines using lambda-policy iteration [<sup>[5]</sup>](#lambdaitnote). Later, even further features were added, including mean column height and the sum of the differences in adjacent column height. Least-squares policy iteration achieved an average score of between 1000 and 3000 lines [<sup>[6]</sup>](#leastsquaresitnote). \n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the design of Tetris, it doesn’t really make sense to have a reward function that gives rewards only at the end of the game. One TD(0)-Learning implementation uses linear combinations of weighted features, such as the value of the highest-used column, the average of the heights of all used columns, the number of holes between pieces at each given time, and the “quadratic unevenness” of the profile (which is a result of summing the squared values of the differences of neighboring columns) [<sup>[7]</sup>](#egreedynote). In order to reduce the state space, a constrained height difference between adjacent columns was used to encode each state. In this experiment, it was shown that lower values of ε were beneficial when using an epsilon-greedy policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tetris can also be modeled as a Markov Decision process if its state space is somehow reduced. Without reduction, a simple 20x10 board has 2200 ways to fill it and even with the requirement that no row be completely full, this is still (210 - 1)20. This 2022 paper’s [<sup>[8]</sup>](#mdpnote) most successful approach, “Fitted Value Iteration”, chose a small set of features and represented each state in terms of this set of features. This method was contingent upon “featurization” of the MDP and a small number of samples from the original state space needed to represent the state-value relationship. The article also found that the features Max-Height, Num-Holes, and Num-Covers were promising features when it came to training an agent."
