We implement several different reinforcement learning algorithms such as TD(0), Monte Carlo Methods, DQN, PPO and Deep-Q networks to investigate the training of agents in the game Tetris. We found that training an agent was difficult because of the vast state-space of the game, which made coming up with heuristics for meaningful rewards very important. 

We used the Tetris Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) for our preliminary models: [Tetris ALE]([https://example.com](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/atari/tetris/ )) and a [more custom Tetris environment](https://github.com/nuno-faria/tetris-ai) for our final models. 

Check out the pdf in this Repository for our full report, as well as our code to see how we approached these problems! Code/notebooks will be labeled with the topics they are investigating.
