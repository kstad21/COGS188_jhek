    "\n",
    "You have the choice of doing either (1) an AI solve a problem style project or (2) run a Special Topics class on a topic of your choice.  If you want to do (2) you should fill out the _other_ proposal for that. This is the proposal description for (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like 8-Queens or a small Traveling Salesman Problem or similar\n",
    "- If its the kind of problem (e.g., RL) that interacts with a simulator or live task, then the problem will have a reasonably complex action space. For instance, a wupus world kind of thing with a 9x9 grid is definitely too small.  A simulated mountain car with a less complex 2-d road and simplified dynamics seems like a fairly low achievement level.  A more complex 3-d mountain car simulation with large extent and realistic dynamics, sure sounds great!\n",
    "- If its the kind of problem that uses a dataset, then the dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training an unsupervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "- The project must include some elements we talked about in the course\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your AI system. Generally RL tasks may require a huge amount of training, so extensive grid search is unlikely to be possible. However expoloring a few reasonable hyper-parameters may still be possible. \n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your AI system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
    "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",

    "Our goal is to create a sketch-to-image tool that takes in a user-inputted sketch and outputs an image based on the sketch in a \\<certain style\\>. We will use a variety of datasets to test our model's capability. One of our datasets will be a large dataset (13.9K observations) of stills taken from Avatar the Last Airbender, an animated show with a recognizable style. Another is SketchyDatabase, a dataset containing sketch-and-realistic-image pairs. The data will need to be translated into numpy arrays for easier manipulation, have normalized RGB values in the range of [0,1], and will be standardized into a fixed dimension. The data will also be partitioned into training, validating, and testing sets for experimental purposes. We will be using edge detection to create \"sketch\" versions of the data for the Avatar dataset, whilst SketchyDatabase already has the sketch and image pairs. We will experiment with a variety of deep learning and diffusion models in attempt to reconstruct the image style from the sketches, and use standard computer vision metrics such as Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) or Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) to evaluate how well our model's reconstructed image compares to the ground-truth."

So use the method that works for you, but do use inline citations.\n",

    "In order to process images to train complicated generative models that we see today, images need to have features extracted. One way to do this is with edge detection, which is used to identify the boundaries of objects within images <a name=\"edgedetectnote\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#edgedetectnote). The Sobel Operator uses two 3x3 convolution kernels to calculate the gradient in vertical and horizontal directions, finding the direction of the largest increase from light to dark and the rate of change in that direction <a name=\"isotropicnote\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#isotropicnote). Later on came the Canny edge detector, which builds on the Sobel Operator and is a \"simple approximimate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image\" <a name=\"cannynote\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#cannynote). Previous work like this will help us with feature detection and also help us create our dataset with sketch-image pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several sketch-to-image models based around deep learning. Pix2Pix's goal is to transform one type of image into another (for example, converting a simple sketch into a realistic image) <a name=\"isolanote\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#isolanote). It uses a generator, which takes an imput image and generates an output image, and a discriminator, which evaluates whether the generated output is from the input dataset or generated by the model. Then it trains the two components together with a minimax framework: the generator tries to minimize the difference between its generated input and the real image, and the discriminator maximizes its ability to correctly classify images <a name=\"goodfellownote\"></a>[<sup>[5]</sup>](#goodfellownote). Many people have used Pix2Pix and trained it on different datasets to create different results, such as this edges2...cats, shoes, handbags, and more <a name=\"demonote\"></a>[<sup>[6]</sup>](#demonote) project, which produces (sometimes worrying) cat-like pictures from a basic sketch, or this Doodles to Pictures! <a name=\"pixnote\"></a>[<sup>[7]</sup>](#pixnote) project which translates sketches in based on different models like cats, birds, lollipops, snakes, and more.\n",

    "Gunjate et al. (2023) <a name=\"gunjatenote\"></a>[<sup>[8]</sup>](#gunjatenote) provides a generative adversarial network method for creating convincing image.

Then the generator network transforms the sketch into a data instance, and the discriminator classifies the generated data.

The generator loss penalizes the generator for failing to \"trick\" the discriminator. \n",

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly describe the problem that you are solving. Avoid ambiguous words. The problem described should be well defined and should have at least one ML-relevant potential solution. Additionally, describe the problem thoroughly such that it is clear that the problem is quantifiable (the problem can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms), measurable (the problem can be measured by some metric and clearly observed), and replicable (the problem can be reproduced and occurs more than once).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that translates hand-drawn sketches into images of a specific style, bridging the gap between abstract line drawings and visual representations. Sketches serve as simplified depictions of objects, often omitting texture, color, and intricate details. The challenge lies in transforming these sketches into images that not only preserve structural integrity but also adhere to a chosen style, whether it be photorealistic, in the style of Avatar, or any domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem can be framed as a self-supervised learning task where the model learns a mapping function between the sketch domain and a target image domain. The model's effectiveness can be evaluated using various metrics. Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) measures the preservation of structural details, while Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) evaluates how closely generated images match the distribution of the target style. Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) provides a perceptual assessment of similarity, ensuring that generated images align with human visual expectations. Additionally, retrieval-based metrics such as Recall@K can assess how accurately the model generates images that fit the intended domain. The problem is also replicable, as the datasets we chose like the Sketchy Database and style-specific datasets provide a consistent framework for training and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several machine learning approaches can be used to address this problem in recent years. Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs), such as Pix2Pix, can generate images conditioned on input sketches while ensuring they adhere to a specific style. Diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, offer fine-grained control over image synthesis by guiding the diffusion process based on sketch constraints. Autoencoder-based models, such as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) or U-Nets, can learn meaningful representations of sketches and transform them into stylized outputs. Style transfer techniques can also be integrated to refine the generated images to better match a particular aesthetic. Each of these methods provides a unique approach to the problem, depending on the desired balance between fidelity to the sketch and adherence to the target style.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to enhance sketch-to-style image translation by leveraging deep learning techniques to generate high-quality, stylized images from sketches. By investigating different modeling approaches and evaluating performance using rigorous metrics, we hope to develop an effective sketch-to-image translation model."
